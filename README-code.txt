Animals with Attributes Dataset, v1.0, May 13th 2009
------------------------------------------------------------------

Example code for training and testing attributes based classification.
The code was originally constructed to run on our computer server 
and will most likely not run out-of-the-box on other installations.

However, we believe it is still useful to release, as it illustrates 
the steps taken to achieve the results reported for "Indirect Attribute 
Prediction (IAP)" and "Direct Attribute Prediction (DAP)".
